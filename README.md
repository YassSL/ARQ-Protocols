# ARQ-Protocols
This project simulates the retranmission protocols that are used in data link layer in OSI model. 
The retranmission protocols that have been studied are ABP (Alternating Bit Protocol) and GBN (Go Back N). 
This project studies the perfomance of the protocols, mainly the throughput of the system
subject to changes in bit error rate, channel capacity, propagation delay and the size of the data frame.
